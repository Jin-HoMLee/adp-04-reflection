    "The code  begins by setting up the environment, loading API keys, and initializing a powerful language model like GPT-4o with a low temperature for focused outputs. The core task is defined by a prompt asking for a Python function to calculate the factorial of a number, including specific requirements for docstrings, edge cases (factorial of 0), and error handling for negative input. The run_reflection_loop function orchestrates the iterative refinement process. Within the loop, in the first iteration, the language model generates initial code based on the task prompt. In subsequent iterations, it refines the code based on critiques from the previous step. A separate \"reflector\" role, also played by the language model but with a different system prompt, acts as a senior software engineer to critique the generated code against the original task requirements. This critique is provided as a bulleted list of issues or the phrase 'CODE_IS_PERFECT' if no issues are found. The loop continues until the critique indicates the code is perfect or a maximum number of iterations is reached. The conversation history is maintained and passed to the language model in each step to provide context for both generation/refinement and reflection stages. Finally, the script prints the last generated code version after the loop concludes."
